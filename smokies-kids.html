				<div class="fact">
					<p>There are at least 30 species of salamanders in the park? GSMNP is sometimes referred to as the Salamander Capital of the World.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<!-- <p>At least 1,500 Black Bears live in the park.</p>
			<p>Right now scientists think that we only know about 17 percent of the plants and animals that live in the park, or about 17,000 species of a probable 100,000 different organisms.</p>
			<p>The barn at the Mountain Farm Museum at Oconaluftee Visitor Center is over 50 feet wide and 60 feet long and over 16,000 hand-split wooden shingles are required to roof it.</p>
			<p>Elk, river otters, and barn owls have all been successfully reintroduced into the Park.</p>
			<p>Money to buy the land that became Great Smoky Mountains National Park was raised by individuals, private groups, and even school children who pledged their pennies.</p>
			<p>There are 97 historic structures, including grist mills, churches, schools, barns, and the homes of early settlers, in the park.</p>
			<p>About 100 native tree species make their home in Great Smoky Mountains National Park—more than in all of northern Europe.</p>
			<p>On the high peaks of the Smokies, an average of 85 inches of rain falls each year, meaning these upper elevation areas are technically temperate rain forests.</p>
			<p>Between 8-10 million people visit Great Smoky Mountains National Park each year, making it the most visited national park in the country.</p> -->
